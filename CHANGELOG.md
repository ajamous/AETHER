## [Unreleased]

### Added

Foundation:
- Repository bootstrap: Apache 2.0 license, README with honest status
  table, CONTRIBUTING, CODE_OF_CONDUCT, SECURITY, GOVERNANCE,
  MAINTAINERS, ROADMAP.
- Makefile with build/test/lint/lab-up/lab-down/lab-test/gen targets,
  per-module iteration, graceful tool-missing diagnostics.
- Go workspace (`go.work`).
- Linter and formatter configs.
- GitHub Actions: ci, release, codeql.
- Issue and pull request templates.
- Documentation skeleton (MkDocs Material), ADRs 0001-0005.
- ASN.1 toolchain scaffolding under `pkg/asn1/sgp22/` with starter
  PEHeader round-trip test.

Crypto primitives (`pkg/crypto`):
- ECDSA P-256 sign/verify with SHA-256 (DER signature shape).
- ECKA over P-256 with X9.63-SHA-256 KDF.
- X9.63 KDF tested against a NIST CAVP vector.
- AES-128-GCM BSP wrappers.
- Brainpool P-256 r1 stubbed pending dependency-vetted curve.

Services (`services/`):
- `hsm-broker`: PKCS#11 façade. Memory and SoftHSM backends both
  implement Sign / GenerateKeyPair / DeriveKey / ListKeys. SoftHSM
  backend exercises real PKCS#11 calls (`CKM_EC_KEY_PAIR_GEN`,
  `CKM_ECDSA`, `CKM_ECDH1_DERIVE` with `CKD_NULL`) and is verified by
  an integration test in CI that installs SoftHSM v2 and round-trips
  a signature against a Go-side ECDSA verify. The X9.63-SHA-256 KDF
  runs in-process on SoftHSM (which doesn't expose `CKD_SHA256_KDF`)
  and the intermediate shared secret is zeroed and destroyed.
  HTTP+JSON server with RFC 7807 errors. Proto contract in
  `api/v1/hsm.proto`.
- `certmgr`: cert chain loading and verification, lab and production
  modes (per ADR 0004), expiry Prometheus metrics, lab-chain
  generator for tests and the local lab.
- `smdp-plus`: ES9+ endpoint skeletons at the SGP.22 paths, session
  state machine, in-memory session store. BPP generation honestly
  returns 501 until the SAIP codec lands.
- `profile-builder`: YAML profile template loader with validation,
  UPP envelope (replaced by SAIP-encoded UPP when the codec lands).
- `gateway`: single entry point. ES2+ skeletons at the SGP.22 paths,
  REST proxies to profile-builder and certmgr.
- `audit`: hash-chained append-only ledger. Append, list, get, verify,
  with tamper detection.
- `smds`: Subscription Manager — Discovery Service (Phase 3).
  ES12 RegisterEvent / DeleteEvent for SM-DP+, ES11 AuthenticateClient
  / GetEvents for the LPA. In-memory event store with idempotent
  registration. Full discovery handshake exercised end-to-end in
  tests. Gateway proxies the admin /v1/events surface for the UI.

Admin UI (`ui/admin/`):
- Next.js 15 (App Router), React 18, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript strict.
- Read-only operator console: dashboard, profile templates,
  certificates, audit log, about page.
- Server-side data fetching only — the browser never talks to
  backend services directly. Helpers in `lib/api.ts`.
- Standalone-mode build, multi-stage Dockerfile.
- No authentication today; lab use only.

Lab and tests:
- Docker Compose at `deployments/docker-compose/lab.yml` brings up
  Postgres, Redis, NATS, certgen, all six Aether services, and the
  admin UI with health-gated startup ordering.
- Lab smoke tests at `test/e2e/`, gated by `-tags=lab`, exercise the
  gateway, certmgr metrics, audit chain, and ES2+ download-order
  round trip.
